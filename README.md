# Laravel Django Authentication
An authentication driver for Laravel5 which allows to authenticate users using their legacy Django PBKDF2 passwords.

## Usage
Add the following service provider to the providers section of ```config/app.php``` :

```php
Jobinja\Djangoable\DjangoableServiceProvider::class
```

Then change your auth driver to ```djangoable``` in ```config/auth.php```.

If you prefer to use database driver instead of eloquent use ```djangoable_database``` instead of
```djangoable```.

### Refreshing passwords on first login
By default after the first login of the user **using a password**, user's password is rehashed based on your laravel hasher contract. If you don't wat
this you can disable it by setting ```rehash_django``` to ```false``` in ```config/auth.php``` :

```php
// auth.php
//...
'rehash_django' => false,
//...
```

### Password field size
Default Laravel5 migration for ```users``` table uses ```VARCHAR(60)``` for password field you should increment it to ```100``` as Django password fields take more space.

#### Tests for hasher contract

Clone the project then run ```vendor/bin/phpunit```.
